# Backtracking
## Backtracking and DFS
Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that is usually implemented using DFS
DFS is a traversal algorithm
Backtracking is the logic on top of it.
Key idea:
1. Choose an option
2. Explore recursively (DFS)
3. Undo the choice if it doesn't work ('backtrack')
